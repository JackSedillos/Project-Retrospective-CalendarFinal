-Withtin the GUI I have implemented a system from which you can input a time and a Description of the event and that event will then appear in the table
-You can add an event at any day of the week and at any time too Using the Add event button which is called on by the add event function
-I have also added a deleter button which can only be activated/work if a Day and a Time is given, if not messagebox will send an error, This message box error also appears if you enter an invalid day, time, or description when trying to add an event
-I also experimented with tkinter's ttk which I used to customize my buttons with Times new roman font, green background, and the Tbutton preset
-I also changed the color of the table using one of the parameters available in tk.Frame, changing the color of the main frame and also the calendar frame
-When you try to add multiple events at the same time it will overide the current event and replace it with the new event at that time

In the beginning when I wrote my goals for this project I hadn't done any of the work and only had a rough idea of what I wanted to work on, thinking I making an app would be the way to go. During the milestone, I realized I wanted to learned how to make GUIs, so I took my orginal idea of making a calendar for students and trying to implement that via a GUI. Now that I'm done with the project I'm very satisfied  with where I ended up. I was able to make a completley functional calander system with time and all 7 days of the week. I learned how to operate GUIs with tkinter and made something functional with little code. Howver, there are still some aspects of the project I would have like to be more polished at this point. For example, I can only add one event per timeslot in a day. If I were to continue with this project, I would want to make more changes like that.
